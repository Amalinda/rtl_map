### FFT-based visualizer for RTL-SDR devices. (RTL2832/DVB-T)

DVB-T dongles based on the `Realtek RTL2832U` can be used as a cheap SDR (_Software-defined radio_), since the chip allows transferring the raw I/Q (_In-phase / Quadrature_) samples to the host, which is officially used for DAB/DAB+/FM demodulation.
